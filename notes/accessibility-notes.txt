What Is Web Accessibility
	>> Websites, tools and technologies should be designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.
		>> Need to percieve, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
		>> Need to be able to contribute to the web
	>> Disabilties include:
		>> Auditory
		>> Cognitive
		>> Neurological
		>> Physical
		>> Speech
		>> Visual
	>> Can also benefit people without disabilities
		>> People using mobile phones, smart watches, and other devices with small screens, different input  modes, ect.
		>> Older people with changing abilities
		>> Temporary disabilities (broken arm, lost glasses)
		>> Situational limitations (bright lit area, can't listen to audio)
		>> Slow internet connection or limited/expensive bandwidth
	>> Accessibility features include:
		>> Video Captions
		>> Colors with Good Contrast
		>> Voice Recognition
		>> Text to Speech
		>> Clear Layout and Design
			>> Clear Headings
			>> Navigation Bars
			>> Consistent Styling
		>> Notifications and Feedback
		>> Large Links, Buttons, and Controls
		>> Customizable Text
			>> Size
			>> Spacing
			>> Font
			>> Colors
		>> Understandable Content
		>> Keyboard Compatibility
	>> Web accessibility is required by law in many situations
		>> Access to information and communication technologies, including the web, is considered a basic human right by the United Nations on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Web Accessibility Principles
	>> Several components must work together
		>> Web Content - Refers to any part of the website (test, images, forms, multimedia, markup code, scripts, applications, etc.)
		>> User Agents - Software used to access web content (graphical browsers, voice browsers, mobile phone browsers, multimedia players, plugins, assistive technologies)
		>> Authoring Tools - Software or services used to produce web content (code editors, document conversion tools, content management systems, blogs, database scripts, and more)
	>> Perceivable Information and User Interface
		>> Text alternatives for non-text content
			>> Short equivalents for images, icons, buttons, and graphics
			>> Descriptions of data on charts, diagrams, and illustrations
			>> Breif description of audio and video files
			>> Labels for form controls, input, and other user interface components
		>> Captions and alternatives to multimedia
			>> Text transcripts and captions for audio content
			>> Audio descriptions, narrations to describe important visual details in video
			>> Sign language interpretations of audio content
		>> Content can be customized
			>> Headings, lists, tables, input fields, and content structures must be marked-up properly
			>> Sequences of information are independant of any presentation
			>> Browsers and assistive technologies provide settings to customize presentation
		>> Content is easy to see and hear
			>> Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or identifying content
			>> Foreground and background colors provide sufficient contrast
			>> When users resize up to 400% or change text spacing, no information is lost
			>> Text reflows in smaller windows and when user makes text larger
			>> Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or avoided wherever possible
			>> Users can pause, stop, and adjust volume of audio that is played on a website
			>> Background audio is low or can be turned off
	>> Operable User Interface and Navigation
		>> Functionality available from keyboard
			>> All functionality available by mouse also available by keyboard
			>> Keyboard focus does not get trapped in any part of content
			>> Web browsers, authoring tools, and other tools provide keyboard support
		>> Users have enough time to read and use content
			>> Stop, extend, and adjust time limits except where necessary
			>> Pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content
			>> Postpone or supress interuptions, except where necessary
			>> Re-authenticate when a session expires without loosing data
		>> Content does not cause seizures or physical reactions'
			>> Do not include content that flashes at particular rates or patterns
			>> Warn users before flashing content is presented, and provide alternatives
			>> Provide mechanics to switch off animations unless essential
		>> Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are
			>> Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive headings
			>> There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages
			>> Users are informed about their current location within a set of related pages
			>> There are ways to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages
			>> The purpose of links are evident, even when the link is viewed on its own
		>> Users can use different input beyond the keyboard
			>> Gestures that require dexterity or fine movement have alternatives that do not require high dexterity
			>> Components are designed to avoid accidental activation (undo function for example)
			>> Lables presented match corresponding object names in the code, to support activation by voice
			>> Functionality activated by movement can also be activated by user interface controls
			>> Buttons, links, and other active components are large enough to be activated by touch
	>> Understandable Information and User Interface
		>> Text is readable and understandable
			>> Identifying the primary language of a website
			>> Identifying the language of any part of the website
			>> Provide definitions for unusual words, phrases, idioms, and abbreviations
			>> Use the clearest and simplest language possible, or provide simplified versions
		>> Content appears and operates in predictable ways
			>> Navigation that appears on multiple pages appears in the same place
			>> User interface options on multiple pages always have the same lables
			>> Significant changes to the website do not happen without consent of the user
		>> Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes
			>> Descriptive instructions, error messages, and suggestions for corrections
			>> Context sensitive help for more complex functionality and interaction
			>> Oportunity to review, correct, or reverse submission if necessary
	>> Robust Content and Reliable Interpretation
		>> Content is compatible with current and future user tools
			>> Ensure markup is reliably interpreted
			>> Provide name, role, and value for non-standard user interface components
